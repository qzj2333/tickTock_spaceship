# Initial Interview question for Tick Tock  
Author: Nicole Wang

## Before run the program
Some constrains are able to change in this program:
* **frameHeight & frameWidth**: length and width for the game frame
* **prob**: percentage of obstacles on one row  
      range: [0, 1]  
      larger value leads to more obstacles and therefore more difficult game level
* **speed**: the falling speed of obstacles, unit in milliseconds  
       larger value leads to slower falling/moving obstacles and therefore easier game level

## How to run the program
Go to the directory that contains the file spaceship.py
run the file in terminal: *python spaceship*
